# 2d system of conservation law

Solves 2d system of conservation laws on Cartesian grids using Legendre basis. The domain need not be a rectangle, but can be anything, but the cells need to be rectangles.

* `euler`: Compressible Euler equations
* `shallow`: Shallow water equations (TODO)

## Exercise: Shallow water equations

Implement shallow water equation model and solve radial dam-break problem, see LeVeque, Sec. 21.7.
