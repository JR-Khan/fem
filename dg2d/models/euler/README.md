# Euler equations for inviscid, compressible gas

This models an ideal, compressible gas with a constant ratio of specific heats gamma. You need to set the value of gamma in the problem file.

## TODO: More test cases

1. Shock reflection from flat wall
1. Subsonic flow over NACA0012 airfoil
1. Subsonic flow over Joukowski airfoil
1. Step in wind tunnel
1. Double mach reflection
